I'm a wandering Physicist and PhD student of Computational Neurobiology at the University of South Florida; looking at a bit of biology and seeing how it can be reduced to variables and equations.

Specifically, I investigate the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases from both a statistical and computational perspective. At the moment, I study the role of disrupted signalling mechanisms in neurons during pathogenesis of neurological disorders. As a result, my research revolves around identifying genomic, molecular, and cellular modules responsible for perturbed: (1) Calcium signaling pathways (2) Neurotransmission (3) Synaptic dysfunction and hyperactivity (4) ATP Supply and Reactive Oxygen Species Production.
